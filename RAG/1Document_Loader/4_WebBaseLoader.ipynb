      "An agent should feel like your chief of staff: you share what you need, it figures out how to get it done, and it improves with feedback. That’s the idea behind Agent Builder.Start by describing your goal in your own words. Agent Builder figures out the approach, guiding you from initial idea to a deployed agent ready to take on your work. It creates detailed instructions, selects the required tools, and even enlists subagents when required.It’s different from traditional workflow automations. You don’t need to map every step, tinker with if-this-then-that branching, or babysit dependencies. You just give it feedback like you would a teammate, and the agent learns using its memory. It’s built from the ground up as an agent, with the ability to plan and iterate until it gets the job done, or seek permission before executing sensitive tasks.Try Agent Builder free today.No-code agents for real workWe built Agent Builder for anyone whose day gets swallowed by routine work. The research, follow-ups, updates, scheduling, and status checks that are essential to your operations, but quickly take over your calendar.Teams have already shipped thousands of agents to production with Agent Builder. It’s especially good at tab-hopping tasks that span multiple apps, docs, and tools, like:Daily briefings: Generate pre-call briefs complete with company and stakeholder research, plus relevant account context from your CRM. Get started with, “Send me a daily meeting brief.”Market + competitor research: Deliver a daily Slack digest of competitor launches, notable social posts, and industry trends your team should know about. Get started with, “Send me a daily competitor update in Slack.”Project tracking: Create Linear issues from PRDs in Notion or Google Docs, then create calendar events for key milestones. Get started with, “Turn my PRDs into Linear issues.”Take your agents furtherFor years, our users–who are primarily developers–have asked us to help equip their co-workers to build agents without writing code. Agent Builder is our answer. What starts as a helpful productivity assistant can evolve into a core part of how your team operates and how you ship software. As your needs grow, you can extend your agents with Agent Builder's full capabilities:Share agents with your team: Create an agent once, then let teammates clone and adapt it using your shared workspace.Add agent capabilities with MCP: Connect additional tools through a remote MCP server, including custom integrations or tools from providers you already use.Choose the right model for the job: Bring your own model to optimize for cost, latency, or capability.Use agents anywhere: Embed agents in your product or call them via API as subagents inside larger graphs.Getting startedAgent Builder is available on all LangSmith plans today. Try it free, then scale as your agent fleet grows, taking on mundane work so you can stay focused on the most important parts of your day.\n",
